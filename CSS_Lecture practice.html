        <p>Despite the brand's success upon launch, it struggled with counterfeits with similar packaging in China. They
            proliferated due the Chinese government turning down Lao Gan Ma's application to trademark the product.[2]
            After the trademark request was denied, counterfeit Lao Gan Ma came to prominence.[6] Tao countered these
            competitors by utilizing a branch of third-party private enterprises to target them.[2][6] In 2001, the high
            court of Beijing ruled that other similar products could not use the "Lao Gan Ma" name nor imitate its
            packaging; Tao received 400,000 RMB in compensation.[7] The trademark application was later approved in 2003
            after a lengthy lawsuit against a counterfeiter based in Hunan.[2]
            Tao Huabi is the owner of the company, and her son Li Guishan became the first president of the company.[2]
            Women of China magazine reported in January 2011 that the company's assets were 1.3 billion RMB (US$190
            million) and that the company had 2,000 employees at that time.[6] The sauce is produced commercially by
            Laoganma Special Flavour Foodstuffs Company,[8] which was established in 1997.[2] By 2022, the condiment
            became more common in locations outside of China.[9]</p>
