  The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round
  short-winged bird, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</a> from <a

    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a>
  around 8,000 years ago.

  Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat
  and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.
</p>

<p> Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population
  of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an annual production of more than 50 billion
  birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are
  numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and
  literature.

<h2>Nomenclature</h2>
<p>Terms for chickens include:
<ul>
  <li>Biddy: a chicken, or a newly hatched chicken<sup>[1][2]</sup></li>
  <li>Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken<sup>[a]</sup></sup></li>
  <li>Chick: a young chicken<sup>[3]</sup></li>
  <li>Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)<sup>[4]</sup></li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the
  legs are unfeathered, and the wings are short.[17] Wild junglefowl can fly;
  chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more
  than a short distance.[18] Size and coloration vary widely between
  breeds.[17] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads
  called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under
  their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males.
  Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face,
  giving the appearance of a beard.[19]

<p>
  Chickens are omnivores.[20] In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search
  for seeds, insects, and animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[21] and
  young mice.[22] A chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the
  breed.[23] The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.[24]

<h2>Reproduction and life-cycle</h2>
<p>
  To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a
  hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the
  hen.[31] The dance triggers a response in the hen[31] and when she responds
  to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.
  Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches the female
  and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs off;
  otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her
  back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending <sup>[32]</sup>

<h2>Origin and dispersal</h2>
<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>
  Red junglefowl, the wild ancestor of the chicken Water or ground-dwelling
  fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird
  that chickens belong to, survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event
  that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their dinosaur relatives.[40]
  Chickens are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and
  are scientifically classified as the same species.[41] Domesticated chickens
  freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[41] The domestic
  chicken has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan
  junglefowl and green junglefowl;[42] a gene for yellow skin, for instance,
  was incorporated into domestic birds from the grey junglefowl (G.
  sonneratii).[43] It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of
  their genome with red junglefowl.[42]

<h3>Domestication</h3>
<p>
  Further information: Domestication Chicken domestication and dispersal[42]
  According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red
  junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with
  minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[44] The red junglefowl is
  well adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced
  during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its own
  reproduction.[45] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of the
  red junglefowl's ability to reproduce prolifically when exposed to a surge
  in its food supply.[46]
