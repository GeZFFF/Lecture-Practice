    <p>Despite the brand's success upon launch, it struggled with counterfeits with similar packaging in China. They
        proliferated due the Chinese government turning down Lao Gan Ma's application to trademark the product.[2] After
        the trademark request was denied, counterfeit Lao Gan Ma came to prominence.[6] Tao countered these competitors
        by utilizing a branch of third-party private enterprises to target them.[2][6] In 2001, the high court of
        Beijing ruled that other similar products could not use the "Lao Gan Ma" name nor imitate its packaging; Tao
        received 400,000 RMB in compensation.[7] The trademark application was later approved in 2003 after a lengthy
        lawsuit against a counterfeiter based in Hunan.[2]</p>
